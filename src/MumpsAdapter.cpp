// MumpsAdapter is now a header-only template class.
// This file is kept for build system compatibility but contains no implementation.
// See MumpsAdapter.h for the complete implementation.

#include "MumpsAdapter.h"

// Explicit template instantiations are not needed since the class is header-only.

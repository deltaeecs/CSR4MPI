// BlasAdapter is now a header-only implementation.
// This file is kept for build system compatibility but contains no implementation.
// See BlasAdapter.h for the complete implementation.

#include "BlasAdapter.h"

// Explicit template instantiations are not needed since the functions are header-only.
